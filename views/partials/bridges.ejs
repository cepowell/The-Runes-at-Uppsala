Somewhere along the way I lost the plot. The desert encroached
<br>
and the edges of the road bled and ran. I woke in a world
<br>
unfamiliar and saw the darkness as you did, through eyes
<br>
that could not focus because they were not mine. When I spoke
<br>
<br>
the words fell through the earth and were lost to me. I imagine
<br>
they reappeared in the inky water of the Thames,
<br>
beneath the statues in Florence, used and wasted, or unheard.
<br>
If I collect every word from every corner of the world
<br>
<br>
and force them into order, maybe the years will fall into sense
<br>
as well. Maybe I will track pain along its path like pins on a map,
<br>
until its origin is clear and alive. Pins on a map, pins in the body,
<br>
a winding line between our hearts that aches sometimes when it rains.
