That winter, a girl who was in love with you
<br>
led me by the hand into a shop that sold yarn.
<br>
Our breath fogged into the air in front of us
<br>
and evergreens gasped for water in the windows
<br>
of the empty street: a stubborn refusal of drought.
<br>
She wanted to knit me socks to keep the cold out,
<br>
although that far south there is no cold so bitter
<br>
as to require wool. The needles that stuck
<br>
out of her backpack were as sharp as her ribs,
<br>
as the thin December air,
<br>
as the loneliness she and I felt around one another.
<br>
We could scarcely breathe for the knowledge
<br>
that each of us knew you in a way we wished we did not
<br>
and in a way we tried so jealously to keep for ourselves.
<br>
<br>
I think perhaps that girl is still there,
<br>
in the shop with the yarn. She wraps herself in wool,
<br>
disturbs the dust on the floor each time she moves.
<br>
Back then the world was a series of anguished highways,
<br>
all of them winding on to somewhere other than where you were.
<br>
My body learned the way to you and I knew the street signs
<br>
like I knew the beat of my heart.
<br>
<br>
I knew the San Francisco fog that burned off early in the morning
<br>
as I started south, clinging to the pavement like a promise I forgot
<br>
to keep. I knew the unpicked fields of Salinas, the long straight fences
<br>
<br>
and yellowing churches of Chualar, the towns where freeways slid
<br>
into highways and became barren and cracked. I knew which mile
<br>
makers were the most alone. I knew the endless expanse of Kern County,
<br>
<br>
broken only by the crooked thirsty trees. I knew the the boundary lines
<br>
where the smog started, thick and gray; the hills that blocked the way
<br>
back. I knew the emptiness of my own throat as I searched for words
<br>
<br>
that you would understand. Years pass and every place is Los Angeles,
<br>
gluing me to the long straight miles before home.
