When I drove away for the last time, I realized
<br>
I had left without the prayerful goodbye
<br>
my prayerless body did not know how to make.
<br>
I left scraps behind me: notes to a future archaeologist
<br>
and my certainty that loss doesnâ€™t change.
<br>
<br>
I hope she finds it, someday. That she stumbles
<br>
upon the stuccoed walls of the courtyards and mistakes
<br>
the crumbling tile for holy. That she scrubs the dirtied
<br>
columns until they glow white and burn the hands
<br>
that touch them. That the relentless blaze of light strips
<br>
the rooms where I slept to the transparent language of bone.
<br>
<br>
The cracked porcelain of a bathtub,
<br>
the rough stone of a bench:
<br>
a church, a god, some hope.
