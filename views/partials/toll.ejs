I forgot that rape is physical.
<br>
Forgot that as it bruises your mind
<br>
it bruises your body and stains the skin.
<br>
That it will not leave the past
<br>
but will not remain there either,
<br>
that it maps the worlds of your future
<br>
onto the hours of your past
<br>
and leaves you slow and staggering
<br>
<br>
like a sleepwalker. One day the roads
<br>
going north will open again
<br>
and I will sleep by the side of the road,
<br>
listening to the rain batter the roof
<br>
of the car and knowing it is better
<br>
than the hush of the palm trees
<br>
and the screams that went through the walls
<br>
and woke the sleepers there.
