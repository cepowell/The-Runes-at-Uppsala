I found the letters I was never supposed to read.
<br>
The electric shock of her lovely handwriting and the geometry
<br>
and her purple ink; the paper worn soft by your two pairs of hands.
<br>
<br>
She said that to be a lover was to savor and swallow the parts of another
<br>
that are ugliest. To map a globe on the body and to plant a flag there -
<br>
here, Sicily, on the back of your knee, Sri Lanka in the part of your hair.
<br>
That some mornings, the current breaks your bones
<br>
until they push through your skin
<br>
and your body washes up
<br>
onto the breathing land.
<br>
<br>
Do you remember when we could still split open in one anotherâ€™s hands?
<br>
When we collapsed against one another, exhausted from nights of no sleep.
<br>
When you were wet from the rain, and good, and kind. When were wounded
<br>
<br>
we slept among the philosophers, fingers sliding into scars
<br>
and the unprotected places of our shared hurt.
<br>
In the winter the light grew thin and failed
<br> 
to keep out the heat: I never wanted one more time,
<br>
for then I would want a thousand. Better none at all.
<br>
On the last day, for a moment:
<br>
the slope of your shoulders as you walked away,
<br>
and I knew.
