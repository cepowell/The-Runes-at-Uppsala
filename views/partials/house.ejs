In the house with the shutters, the wet grass began to burn
<br>
early, on fire in the unrelenting light. Behind every corner
<br>
was the still-sleeping body of a memory I canâ€™t look at
<br>
anymore: the hush of the palm trees whispering their fronds
<br>
against the heat, the screams that went through the walls
<br>
and woke the sleepers there.
<br>
<br>
I cannot unlearn those sullen southern freeways
<br>
or the late-night Technicolor restaurants made hazy and gray
<br>
by the dawn. In the desert they are the tallest things around.
<br>
I cannot unlearn the clocks that ticked off-time
<br>
from one another, the hearts that pressed themselves
<br>
against other hearts,
<br>
<br>
<i>Are you what I am needing?,</i>
<br>
<br>
and never found the sameness of identical flesh
<br>
or a common rhythm. Your tongue is over-brewed tea:
<br>
sharp, sipped, half-swallowed, spit back into the cup
<br>
when no one is looking. I still taste it and some days
<br>
it tastes good. Some days I am on fire too, falling to the ground
<br>
with the few leaves that resisted the unending green,
<br>
the unending brightness, so vivid and so unreal.
