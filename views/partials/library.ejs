It’s a subconjunctival hemorrhage, they said.
<br>
It’ll go away on its own. What they meant
<br>
was that the white of my eye had turned red
<br>
and the word had gone orange with artificial fall.
<br>
<br>
I was a collage of the marks I had asked for
<br>
and those I had never wanted, a museum
<br>
that strangers entered and tried to touch.
<br>
Fingers across the point of my cheekbone
<br>
to brush away an eyelash, to feel me,
<br>
to ask with the urgency of pressure
<br>
the questions no one knew how to vocalize.
<br>
<br>
That night I became legible to anyone. Anyone
<br>
who knew that pressure around a throat
<br>
bursts vessels in an eye, who knew what it was to wake
<br>
to fevered air and find the sheets tangled, damp,
<br>
unclean. Anyone who knew the slant of light
<br>
<br>
as it rose over the elms in the morning and blazed
<br>
against the white sand, the white buildings,
<br>
all of the purest places.
<br>
Anyone who had walked paths that turned
<br>
under their feet
<br>
into memory, wordless and communicable only
<br>
by touch.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who dreams of a cool room, a dry bed,
<br>
the sanctity of loneliness; but, too, anyone
<br>
who is terrified of those things, who cannot
<br>
<br>
be left alone.
<br>
Anyone who knows the layers of things.
<br>
First anger,
<br>
then mourning,
<br>
and at the bottom is love, curled and lurking.
<br>
<br>
That night I said <i>Red</i> but you must have been reading
<br>
some other language,
<br>
invisible but for the welts on my legs, the bruises
<br>
on my ribs. My words must have erupted
<br>
from my throat and flooded my eye,
<br>
colored the sclera so no one, not even you,
<br>
could claim illiteracy.
