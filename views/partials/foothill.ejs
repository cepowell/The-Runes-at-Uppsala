Like any good American, I learned to grieve
<br>
by hitting the road. To stagger into shelter
<br>
as the winter rain rolled in and to tumble
<br>
to the streets with its exit. I learned
<br>
the gas station songs we sing to strangers
<br>
as tired night eyes meet over the pumps – these
<br>
<br>
are the songs I sang, the flat desert songs.
<br>
But I know now that some heavy mornings,
<br>
wakefulness is the same thing as heat,
<br>
and that to travel is to carve the land
<br>
with the days you leave to the people you’ve left
<br>
<br>
behind. A summer storm surprised us once -
<br>
do you remember? - and, for a few hours,
<br>
washed the miles from the wheels, from the road,
<br>
from our eyes. The bruises that painted my body
<br>
faded and the defeat I wore like a coat slid away.
<br>
I thought the exhaustion in our bones
<br>
would wash away too. I thought, then, just then,
<br>
that all obedience was holy and all subservience
<br>
<br>
pure. But some exhaustion won’t be shaken.
<br>
It sleeps by the side of the long dry highways
<br>
and drags us south by the hair. There is no shelter
<br>
but the weight of remembering when grief
<br>
could be eased with the rhythm of the road
<br>
and when pain could be left to the days we leave
<br>
<br>
behind.
