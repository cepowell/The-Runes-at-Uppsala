I meet the girl I used to be at a cafe in San Francisco.
<br>
Her mouth bursts with wishes that rise to the rafters
<br>
and crash to the floor, delicate as a coffee cup
<br>
and coarse as the grounds left floating there.
<br>
The man beside her is shaped from the voices
<br>
he has stolen from throats left gasping and dry.
<br>
His eyes are bitter and burned.
<br>
<br>
She slides her hand into his and shrinks, molds,
<br>
takes the shape of the empty space inside the cave
<br>
of his palm. She has hollowed herself for him.
<br>
Her heart is the flesh of a melon, spooned from the rind
<br>
and slipped between his lips: the edges of his teeth
<br>
jagged with the strands of her body, his nails filed
<br>
into points to cause the most pain
<br>
when they force their way into the rawest places of her.
<br>
<br>
She and I stand still in a surging room.
<br>
Unfamiliar mouths distort the air between us,
<br>
unfamiliar eyes take up the space
<br>
we have forgotten how to share. I reach for her,
<br>
hungry, until I am reaching for who we were
<br>
and who we are afraid we will become.
<br>
Our fingers touch and slide apart.
<br>
<br>
The three of us walk outside as though strangers,
<br>
into a world that has darkened without our notice.
<br>
From a porch many blocks away, "Harvest Moon"
<br>
wends its ghostly way between the streetlamps
<br>
and the lights that glow over doorways.
<br>
Soon enough they will both be gone, called south,
<br>
on the long flat highways home.
<br>
To the place where it happened,
<br>
where it will happen,
<br>
where it is always happening.
<br>
There will be no more boundaries between her and I,
<br>
between our body and his, between our tangled
<br>
legs and the blaze of the Southern California sun.
<br>
Hold on to your mind. You will not have it for long.
