Many years before I met you, a professor committed suicide
<br>
two weeks into the fall semester on the porch of a house
<br>
a few miles from his office. I walked past that office daily,
<br>
back then. When I was with you I understood. Save me, I said,
<br>
when what I meant was, Save me from you.
<br>
<br>
Because I could not contemplate my own anguish I contemplated his.
<br>
I imagined that the grand arc of his grief stretched under him,
<br>
like a hammock or a crescent moon, and that it was possible to sleep there
<br>
and to rise from it in the morning. The hot hallucinatory pavement of Sixth
<br>
grew more real to me than the rough tips of your fingers at my neck,
<br>
the snarl on your face when your anger burst the dams of your body
<br>
and poured its way into mine. I wonder if they werenâ€™t the same, in the end.
<br>
<br>
I read an article about the professor a long while later
<br>
and I searched for the address of the house where he died.
<br>
Not to find it, or to go there, but to see how near it was
<br>
to the places where I died, piece by piece,
<br>
and scattered myself, unknowing, to the wind.
