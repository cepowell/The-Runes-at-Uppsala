The first time I felt the uncomprehending weight
<br>
of the things youâ€™d done to me, I stood in the dying
<br>
three p.m. light and watched the last shards
<br>
of the sun slide across the face of a man who loved me.
<br>
He knelt in the snow, camera pointed up to the arches
<br>
and turrets of the grand red buildings above us.
<br>
His fierce concentration, his numb hands,
<br>
the flush of his face: students moved like water
<br>
around our stationary bodies and he was still,
<br>
calm, waiting with the constancy of the candles
<br>
that had begun to burn in all the windows.
<br>
Sweden in January and he was on fire with waiting.
<br>
<br>
I regret that his was not the hand I wanted to hold
<br>
as I stood in front the runestones outside the cathedral,
<br>
as the clouds gathered and blocked what remained
<br>
of the light. Believe me: if I could have stripped my skin
<br>
of California and left it there, to be buried by the storm,
<br>
I would have. If I could have chosen the life I wanted
<br>
to share, if I could have chosen the face I wanted to touch:
<br>
if I could have chosen, I would have. But he and I
<br>
were separate people, in our separate skins.
<br>
I could not know him the way that I still know you.
<br>
<br>
Because the dust and heat linger in the cracks of my palms.
<br>
They trap me in the body of the woman who tried to leave,
<br>
my body, when I was twenty-one and traumatized,
<br>
afraid of the wastelands of the Inland Empire
<br>
and the long dry roads going north. Afraid of the elms
<br>
that shaded my mortarboard, afraid of the golden
<br>
evening light. Most of all afraid of the words
<br>
I will never find to capture the impenetrable loss
<br>
of remembering a place that may or may not have existed.
<br>
I read the runes at Uppsala and saw the lines carved
<br>
into the skin of California.
