Back then there were rules for survival. With you
<br>
there were rules for sanity and for staying alive.
<br>
<br>
One: you must never sleep through the dying
<br>
of the light or drive through the setting of the sun.
<br>
<br>
If you do, you will come to in the dark of a country
<br>
foreign to you and your body will wash up
<br>
<br>
on the shore there, unknowable and unowned.
<br>
Two: you must never fall asleep and wake
<br>
<br>
when the landing gear hits the runway, a jolt
<br>
of land and enclosure, or you will wake up one day
<br>
<br>
to find a pillow over your face, a hand at your throat,
<br>
the beating of your heart in your ears replaced
<br>
<br>
by the steady rhythm of a voice that used to mean love.
<br>
Three: you must never forget that every stocky body
<br>
<br>
disappearing around a corner, every broad back
<br>
sliding past a courtyard or through a doorway,
<br>
<br>
could be his. Chances were coins I threw in a fountain,
<br>
none amounting to much until my pockets were empty
<br>
<br>
and the roads going north were closed, blocked with rain.
<br>
When did I lose the chance to survive unchanged?
